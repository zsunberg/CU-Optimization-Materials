ASEN 6519 DMU++ Final Project Presentation Assignment
=========================

The final assignment for the class is a final project. This is the presentation component. The presentation is a chance to share what you have learned in your project with the rest of the class. In this way, a high quality final project presentation benefits the entire class.

Assignment Scope
----------------

You will give a 12-15 minute presentation on the date assigned to you on the course schedule. You will then have 3-6 minutes to answer questions.

You should cover, at least at a high level, all of the sections outlined in the project *report* assignment. However, since some of the presentations are before the project report is due, you do not need to have all results completed. The minimum requirement for the presentation is to have **a result**, i.e. the optimization is working an has found a solution to at least a basic version of the problem. The report may contain more results than you are able to present.

Target Audience
---------------

The target audience that you should address is a peer in this class. You can assume the audience will be familiar with the basic concepts introduced in the class, but you should describe the details of the work you did.

Concrete deliverables
---------------------

You must submit a pdf version of your slides by the beginning of class on the day that you present.  I am not requiring early slide submission like I did for the paper presentations, but please remember that starting to think about slides on the last day is likely to result in a presentation that you are not happy with.
