ASEN 6519 Optimization Final Project Report Assignment 
=========================================

The final assignment for the class is report on your final project. The
goal is to produce a paper that is similar to a conference paper (but
probably with narrower scope and less novelty).

Formatting
----------

The length must be between 4 and 8 pages *not including references*. You
may include appendices with additional details, but I may not have time
to read them. I recommend using the IEEE format - templates can be found
here: <https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html>. You
may use other formats, but they should be single spaced and have margins
similar to the IEEE format (i.e. versions suitable for final submission
to a conference rather than drafts).

Target Audience 
---------------

The target audience that you should write to is a peer in this class.
You can assume the reader will be familiar with the basic concepts
introduced in the class, but you should describe the details of the work
you did.

Outline 
-------

I recommend using the following outline (you don't have to use this
exactly, but all of the info should be included):

1.  Introduction

2.  Background and Related Work

3.  Problem Formulation (make sure to clearly define S, A, T, and R if
    you are using an MDP example)

4.  Solution Approach

5.  Results (plots and tables - quantify the uncertainty if possible)

6.  Conclusion (and possible Future Work if you want to describe
    potential extensions)

7.  Contributions and Release (see below)

Additional Required Items 
=========================

-   You must conduct a basic familiarization of literature related to
    your project. Your report should contain **at least 5 citations of
    related published work** and a brief description of how these relate
    to your project.

-   At the end of the report include a few sentences about the
    **contributions of each team member** (e.g. \"Bob collected and
    cleaned the data, Alice implemented the algorithm\", etc.)

-   At the end of the report, **indicate whether you are willing to
    share the report publicly** for other students to benefit from. I
    highly recommend choosing to share since future students may be able
    to build off of or be inspired by your work. **Please include one of
    the following release sentences**: \"The authors grant permission
    for this report to be posted publicly.\" or \"The authors do NOT
    grant permission for this report to be posted publicly.\"

-   Clearly **indicate which algorithms you implemented from scratch**
    vs used off-the-shelf implementations.
