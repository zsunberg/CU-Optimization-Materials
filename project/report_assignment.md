ASEN 6519 Optimization Final Project Report Assignment 
=========================================

The last major assignment for the class is the final project. This is the report component of the project. The goal is to produce a paper that is similar to a conference paper (but probably with narrower scope and less novelty).

Formatting
----------

The length must be between 4 and 8 pages *not including references*. You
may include appendices with additional details, but I may not have time
to read them. I recommend using the IEEE format - templates can be found
here: <https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html>. You
may use other formats, but they should be single spaced and have margins
similar to the IEEE format (i.e. versions suitable for final submission
to a conference rather than drafts).

Target Audience 
---------------

The target audience that you should write to is a peer in this class.
You can assume the reader will be familiar with the basic concepts
introduced in the class, but you should describe the details of the work
you did.

Outline 
-------

I recommend using the following outline (you don't have to use this
exactly, but all of the info should be included):

1.  Introduction

2.  Background and Related Work

3.  Problem Formulation 

4.  Solution Approach

5.  Results (plots and/or tables)

6.  Conclusion (and possible Future Work if you want to describe
    potential extensions)

7.  Contributions and Release (see below)

Additional Required Items 
=========================

-   You must conduct a basic familiarization of literature related to
    your project. Your report should contain **at least 5 citations of
    related work published in an academic journal or conference proceedings** and a brief description of how these relate
    to your project.

-   At the end of the report include a few sentences about the
    **contributions of each team member** (e.g. \"Bob collected and
    cleaned the data, Alice implemented the algorithm\", etc.)

-   At the end of the report, **indicate whether you are willing to share the report publicly** for other students to benefit from. I highly recommend choosing to share since future students may be able to build off of or be inspired by your work. **Please include one of the following release sentences**: \"The authors grant permission for this report to be posted publicly.\" or \"The authors do NOT grant permission for this report to be posted publicly.\"
-   Clearly **indicate which algorithms you implemented from scratch** vs used off-the-shelf implementations.

Late Policy
-----------

Since the review assignment depends on everyone submitting their reports, the normal 72-hour 10% off late policy does not apply. Instead, if it is turned in late, it MUST be turned in within 24 hours of the original due date and there will be a 10% penalty for late submissions.
